## introduction
### Unsolved problems：
Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?；

Those non-coding region may actually be 'coding region'of RNAs.(extension of concept of 'genes')

To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked?

### Concept of genome and Central Dogma
## Sequence technique
### feature: Big and HD
### 3 steps of bioformatics:
1. Information
2. **Model**
3. **Algorithm**

Model

eg.Neural network

By modeling, we turn a specific question into one that can be described by mathematical linguistics and solved by computer. 

Algorithm

eg. Number Sorting Algorithm

We can develop many algorithm to solving question faster or more convenient. Compared with 'model',developing algorithm is like developing and sharpening a tool. Algorithm supports operation of model. 

## Plan for studing bioformatics

do preview before class

organize the tutorial articles which I learned from, review them and make sure I command those skills.make sure I can find them later

apply bioformatics skills to my research program in lab to analyze amino acid composition of LCD.
