## introduction
### Unsolved problems：
Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?；

Those non-coding region may actually be 'coding region'of RNAs.(extension of concept of 'genes')

To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked?

### Concept of genome and Central Dogma
## Sequence technique
### feature: Big and HD
### 3 steps of bioformatics:
1. Information
2. **Model**

eg.Neural network

By modeling, we turn a specific question into one that can be described by mathematical linguistics and solved by computer. 
3. **Algorithm**

eg. Number Sorting Algorithm

We can develop many algorithm to solving question faster or more convenient. Compared with 'model',developing algorithm is like developing and sharpening a tool. Algorithm supports operation of model.
